## **Installation**

You can set up NexusCRM using either Docker (recommended) or traditional PHP/MySQL installation.

### **Option 1: Docker Setup (Recommended)** ⭐

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Node.js and npm

**Steps:**

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/samuelrods/NexusCRM.git
cd NexusCRM
```

2. Copy the environment file:
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Update `.env` with Docker database configuration:
```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=nexus_crm
DB_USERNAME=nexus
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

Set to database for local dev to avoid API errors
```env
SCOUT_DRIVER=database
```

4. Build and start Docker containers:
```sh
docker-compose up -d --build
```

5. Install Dependencies (Inside Container):
```sh
docker-compose exec app composer install
docker-compose exec app npm install
```

6. Generate application key:
```sh
docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate
```

7. Run migrations and seed the database:
```sh
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate --seed
```

8. Build Frontend Assets:
```sh
docker-compose exec app npm run build
```

9. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000`

**Useful Docker Commands:**
```sh
# View logs
docker-compose logs -f app

# Stop containers
docker-compose down

# Restart containers
docker-compose restart

# Run artisan commands
docker-compose exec app php artisan [command]
```

```sh
php artisan serve
```

2. Start the Vite dev server (in a separate terminal):
```sh
npm run dev
```

3. The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

4. Login with seeded credentials (if you ran the seeder) or create a new account

## **Database Schema**

The application features a sophisticated multi-tenant database architecture with **15+ interconnected tables**:

- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Implementing organization-scoped data isolation
- **Complex Database Design**: Creating normalized schemas with 15+ interconnected tables
- **RBAC Implementation**: Building a flexible role and permission system using laravel-permission
- **Business Logic**: Modeling real-world CRM workflows (leads → deals → conversions)
- **Data Relationships**: Working with complex many-to-many and polymorphic relationships

### Full-stack Integration
- **Laravel + React + Inertia.js**: Seamless integration of backend and frontend
- **API Design**: Creating maintainable RESTful endpoints
